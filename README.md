These data would indicate that the compound vader analysis score for each news outlet could be largely attributed to chance. The differences in the data between the networks are little to none,  and there is no observable trend when looking at a scatterplot of the vader analysis of each tweet.  many of the tweets have a score of zero.  To get a true sense of the patterns of twitter sentiment for each news network, you would need a way to filter out many of the links or things that do not have any sentiment in them that may be showing up as zero on the scatter plot.  at least within the last hundred tweets from when I took the data, there is no significant difference between the compound scores of the vader analysis of each tweet, on an individual and overall-level.
